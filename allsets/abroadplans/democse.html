                        <h4>Entryway:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Undergraduate:</strong> Exceptional academic performance in high school, especially in advanced mathematics (calculus, linear algebra) and physics, is crucial. Strong SAT/ACT scores (often 1500+ for SAT, 34+ for ACT), compelling personal essays demonstrating passion for CS, strong letters of recommendation, and significant extracurricular involvement (coding clubs, hackathons, personal projects) are essential.</p>
                        <p><strong>Graduate (Master's/Ph.D.):</strong> A strong bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a closely related field with a high GPA (typically 3.5/4.0 or above). GRE scores are often required, with high quantitative scores expected. A well-articulated statement of purpose outlining research interests, strong letters of recommendation, and a comprehensive CV/resume highlighting research experience, publications, or relevant work experience are critical. For international students, strong TOEFL or IELTS scores are mandatory.</p>
